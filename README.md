# Predicting the INFLUENCERS
 Predicting social media influencers with predictive and network analytics

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a model to predict influencers from twitter activity data of users and quantify their potential financial value.
Using the influence scores, we will try to find top-20 influencers in a separate tweets dataset.

### Part-1
> We will utilize this twitter [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-who-is-more-influential-in-a-social-network) to build a model and validate a model that will predict the influencers. Each observation in the dataset describes two individuals, A and B. There are 11 variables for each person based on Twitter activity, e.g., number of followers, retweets, network characteristics, etc. Each observation shows whether A > B (Choice = “1”) or B > A (Choice = “0”).

### Part-2
> Here, we will utilize another tweets [database](https://github.com/pratyush335/Predicting-the-INFLUENCERS/tree/main/Data) to identify the top 20 influencers by calculating the influence scores using the weights predicted in the first part.
